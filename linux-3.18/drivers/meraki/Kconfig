config MERAKI_CONFIG
	tristate "Meraki Board Data support"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This option enables support for the meraki-config device, which
	  proxies the content of the board ID EEPROM to a known location.

	  It also provides kernel access to the Meraki product type.

	  If your board has a board ID EEPROM on it, say Y here.

config CISCO_MPS
    bool "Cisco MPS Support"
    depends on POWER_SUPPLY
    help
      This is a driver for an I2C-connected MPS device

config CISCO_RPS
       bool "Cisco RPS 2300 driver support"
       depends on I2C && POWER_SUPPLY
       default n
       ---help---
         This option enables support for interfacing with an external
         Cisco RPS 2300 over I2C and GPIOs.

         Say N here if you don't know whether or not your device
         supports the Cisco RPS 2300.

config MERAKI_SFP_USER
       bool "Meraki SFP/SFP+ Socket Support (user-mode)"
       depends on I2C && GPIOLIB
       help
         This is a proxy driver for an I2C-connected SFP/SFP+/QSFP socket.
         The actual driving of the socket will be performed in userspace.

config CISCO_ACT2
       bool "Cisco ACT2 support"
       default n
       help
         This is a driver to communicate with the Cisco ACT2 security chip.
         The device is used for various types of encryption. It has on-board,
         protected EEPROM so it can generate and securely store keys.

config CISCO_ACT2_I2C
	bool "Cisco ACT2 I2C support"
	depends on I2C && CISCO_ACT2
	default n
	help
         This is a driver to communicate with the Cisco ACT2 security chip.
         The device is used for various types of encryption. It has on-board,
         protected EEPROM so it can generate and securely store keys.

         This is an I2C-connected device.

config CISCO_ACT2_SPI
	bool "Cisco ACT2 SPI support"
	depends on SPI && CISCO_ACT2
	default n
	help
         This is a driver to communicate with the Cisco ACT2 security chip.
         The device is used for various types of encryption. It has on-board,
         protected EEPROM so it can generate and securely store keys.

         This is an SPI-connected device.
