Description of kernel patches:


generic/
	Generic patches for vanilla Linux kernel

000-linux_mips.patch
	This is the diff between vanilla linux-2.4.32 and linux-mips.org kernel
	(CVS tag 2_4_32-rc1 used). The kernel source from linux-mips.org CVS repository has
	newer drivers and code then vanilla linux-2.4.32 especially for the mips architecture.

001-squashfs.patch
	Support for the squashfs filesystem. It has better compression ratio then cramfs.

002-squashfs_lzma.patch
	LZMA Addon patch from Oleg I. Vdovikin for the squashfs filesystem. 
	Even better compression ratio. 

003-jffs2_compression.patch
	Compression for jffs2 filesystem.

004-exec_pagesize.patch

005-mtd_flashtypes.patch
	Additional mtd drivers for flash chips

100-ebtables.patch
	Filtering packets on ethernet layer. See http://ebtables.sf.net

101-netfilter_ipp2p.patch
	Netfilter ipp2p match module (matches traffic of most P2P networks)

102-netfilter_layer7.patch

103-netfilter_nat_pptp.patch
	NAT support for PPTP and GRE

104-netfilter_maxconn.patch

105-netfilter_TTL.patch
	Netfilter target for manipulating the TTL of IP packets

106-mppe_mppc.patch
	Microsoft PPP Encryption/Compression

107-cifs.patch
	CIFS (Common Internet File System) module.

108-optional_aout_support.patch

109-ipsec_nat_traversal.patch
	Openswan patch for allowing IPSec through NAT

110-netdev_random_core.patch
	Support for gathering entropy from network devices for /dev/random

200-i4l.patch

201-hfc_usb_backport.patch

202-pl2303_backport.patch

203-hfsplus_fix.patch

204-net_b44.patch
	Support for the BCM47xx chipset in the b44 driver

206-gcc_3.4_fixes.patch
	mips specific gcc 3.4 fixes

207-gcc_4.0_fixes.patch
	gcc 4.0 fixes


brcm/
	Broadcom specific patches

001-bcm47xx.patch
	This is the broadcom specific code from asus (1941) GPL source tarball. 
	There are many small patches included, so it works with linux 2.4.32 kernel. 
	The original code is based on Linux 2.4.20.

002-wl_fix.patch
	The driver for the wireless lan chip on brcm47xx based routers is binary only. 
	This means it depends on older data structures in the kernel. We backported some
	of the changes or changed some of the data structures to work with the binary modul. 
	This is a really bad hack, but without source code, there is no better chance to get
	the driver working with newer kernels.

003-bcm47xx_cache_fixes.patch


ar7/
	TI AR7 specific patches

000-ar7_support.patch

001-flash_map.patch
