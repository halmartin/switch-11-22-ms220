	  With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional 
	  filesystem in a userspace program.
	  
	  Features include:
	  
	   * Simple library API
	   * Simple installation (no need to patch or recompile the kernel)
	   * Secure implementation
	   * Userspace - kernel interface is very efficient
	   * Usable by non privileged users
	   * Runs on Linux kernels 2.4.X and 2.6.X
	   * Has proven very stable over time
