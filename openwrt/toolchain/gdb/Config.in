	    Build gdb to run on the host to debug programs running on the target.

config BR2_TARGET_DEBUGGER_INFO
       bool "Compile target binaries with debugging information"
       default n
       depends BR2_PACKAGE_GDB_CLIENT
       help
            Compile the target binaries with debugging information. This
	    will increase the size of the binaries on the debugging host,
	    but not on the target system. Without this enabled, gdb
	    is mostly useless. Enable this feature unless you are
	    very limited on disk space on your development system.
