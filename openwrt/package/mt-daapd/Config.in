	  mt-daapd is a program which acts as an iTunes (DAAP) server for Linux and 
	  other POSIX unixes. It may eventually support Win32 as well.
	  
	  Some random features that it supports:
	  
	    * Supports the Roku SoundBridge (query/browse/index support) 
	    * Supports periodic rescans of the database 
	    * Can advertise shoutcast streams 
	    * Supports password-protected shares 
	    * Is web-configurable and managable 
	    * Support dynamic playlists, like iTunes "Smart playlists" 
	    * Probably other things I've forgotten 
	  
	  All is not perfect, however. Currently, there are several drawbacks to it:
	  
	    * database is indexed by inode, so all music must be on one filesystem 
	    * browse by artist is slow on Roku, times out (with large databases ~10K songs) 
	    * Probably other things I've forgotten
