	  Lightweight package management system
	  ipkg is the Itsy Package Management System, for handling
	  installation and removal of packages on a system. It can
	  recursively follow dependencies and download all packages
	  necessary to install a particular package.
	  
	  ipkg knows how to install both .ipk and .deb packages.
	  
	  ipkg is intended to serve the same functions (and more) for
	  Familiar that dpkg and apt serve for Debian, (while taking
	  up much less space).
