	  p910nd  is a small daemon that copies any data received on
	  the port it is listening on to the  corresponding  printer
	  port.   It  is primarily intended for diskless Linux hosts
	  running as printer drivers but there is no reason  why  it
	  could  not  be used on diskful hosts.  Port 9100 is copied
	  to /dev/lp0, 9101 to /dev/lp1 and 9102 to  /dev/lp2.   The
	  default is port 9100 to /dev/lp0.
