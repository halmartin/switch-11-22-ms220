Description: TMSNC is a textbased (console) MSN client written in C. TMSNC should work on most Unix (Linux, BSD, MacOS) compatible operating systems. The goal of this project is to create a client like MSN Messenger (with sound, webcam and file transfer support), but without any graphical features.
Depends: libncurses, libopenssl
