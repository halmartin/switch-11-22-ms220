	  gpsd is a monitor daemon that watches a TCP/IP port (2947 by default), 
	  waiting for applications to request information from GPSes or 
	  differential-GPS radios attached to the host machine. Each GPS or 
	  radio is expected to be direct-connected to the host via a USB or 
	  RS232C serial port. The port may be specified to gpsd at startup, or 
	  it may be set via a command shipped down a local control socket (e.g. 
	  by a USB hotplug script). Given a GPS device by either means, gpsd 
	  discovers the correct port speed and protocol for it.
