	  PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) 
	  based on POSTGRES, Version 4.2, developed at the University of 
	  California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. POSTGRES pioneered 
	  many concepts that only became available in some commercial database 
	  systems much later.

	  PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. 
	  It supports SQL92 and SQL99 and offers many modern features:

	    * complex queries
	    * foreign keys
	    * triggers
	    * views
	    * transactional integrity
	    * multiversion concurrency control
	  
	  http://www.postgresql.org/
	  
	  This package contains the shared client library, needed by other programs.

	  This package contains a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables 
	  you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the 
	  query results.  Alternatively, input can be from a file. In addition, it 
	  provides a number of  meta-commands  and  various  shell-like features to 
	  facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks.
