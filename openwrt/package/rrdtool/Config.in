	  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
	  display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
	  server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
	  not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
	  to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
	  scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
	  put friendly user interface on it.
