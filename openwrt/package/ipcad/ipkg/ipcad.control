Description: IPCAD stands for IP Cisco Accounting Daemon. It runs in background, listens traffic on the specified interfaces, and records the traffic for later retrieval and analysis. IPCAD can use raw BPF devices, PCAP library, divert, tee or Linux iptables' ULOG & IPQ packet sources to capture the packets.
