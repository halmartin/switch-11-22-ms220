		syslog-ng reads and logs messages to the  system  console,  log
		files, other machines and/or users as specified by its
		configuration file.

		The  configuration  file is read at startup and is reread after
		receipt of a hangup (HUP) signal.  When reloading the
		configuration  file,  all destination  files  are  closed  and
		reopened as appropriate. For more information about the
		configuration file, see syslog-ng.conf(5).

		Typically messages are sent to  syslog-ng  via  a  Unix  domain
		socket (/dev/log) or via UDP, to port 514 or to whatever
		syslog/udp is defined to be in /etc/services.  To receive
		messages from the kernel, /dev/klog is opened for reading.

		Messages sent to syslog-ng should be an entire line, prefixed
		by a pri- ority code in between '<' and '>'.   Definititions
		of  the  recognised values can be found in the include file
		<sys/syslog.h>.

		syslog-ng  can  be  configured to pass messages on to other
		syslog-ng's and when doing so, it sends the message on with the
		priority as a  pre- fix.
