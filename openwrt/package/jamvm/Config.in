	  JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
	  specification version (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's
	  (free and commercial) it is extremely small.However, unlike other
	  small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full
	  specification, and includes support for object finalisation,
	  Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the
	  Reflection API.
