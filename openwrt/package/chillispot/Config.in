	  access point controller. It is used for authenticating users
	  of a wireless LAN. It supports web based login which is today's
	  standard for public HotSpots and it supports Wireless Protected
	  Access (WPA) which is the standard of the future. Authentication,
	  authorization and accounting (AAA) is handled by your favorite
