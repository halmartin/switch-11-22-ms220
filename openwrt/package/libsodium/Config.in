	  NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software
	  library for network communication, encryption, decryption,
	  signatures, etc.  NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core
	  operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.  Sodium
	  is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of
	  NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221),
	  with a compatible API.  The design choices, particularly in regard to
	  the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function, emphasize security (whereas
	  NIST curves emphasize "performance" at the cost of security), and
	  "magic constants" in NaCl/Sodium have clear rationales.  The same
	  cannot be said of NIST curves, where the specific origins of certain
	  constants are not described by the standards.  And despite the
	  emphasis on higher security, primitives are faster across-the-board
	  than most implementations of the NIST standards.
