	  Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg 
	  Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet 
	  radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in 
	  between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added 
	  relatively easily and supports open standards for commuincation and 
	  interaction.
