	  SQLite is a small C library that implements a self-contained, embeddable, 
	  zero-configuration SQL database engine. Features include:
	  
	    * Transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) 
	      even after system crashes and power failures.
	    * Zero-configuration - no setup or administration needed.
	    * Implements most of SQL92. (Features not supported)
	    * A complete database is stored in a single disk file.
	    * Database files can be freely shared between machines with different 
	      byte orders.
	    * Supports databases up to 2 terabytes (241 bytes) in size.
	    * Sizes of strings and BLOBs limited only by available memory.
	    * Small code footprint: less than 30K lines of C code, less than 250KB 
	      code space (gcc on i486)
	    * Faster than popular client/server database engines for most common 
	      operations.
	    * Simple, easy to use API.
	    * TCL bindings included. Bindings for many other languages available 
	      separately.
	    * Well-commented source code with over 95% test coverage.
	    * Self-contained: no external dependencies.
	    * Sources are in the public domain. Use for any purpose.
