	  The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function 
	  when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout 
	  has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due 
	  to signals or regular timeouts.
	  
	  libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven 
	  network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() 
	  and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change 
	  the event loop.
