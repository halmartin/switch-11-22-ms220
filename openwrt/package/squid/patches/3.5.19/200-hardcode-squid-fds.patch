    PATCH: modify the squid configure script to set SQUID_MAXFD to 16384.
    
    Squid is annoying, and does not observe any of the configuration variables we pass
    to the configure script, due to what we believe is inconsistencies with our cross
    compilations versus the squid developers idea of cross compilation.  Since Squid is
    on the way out, I feel okay with this disgusting hack.
