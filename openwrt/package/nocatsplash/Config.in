	  NoCatSplash is an Open Public Network Gateway Daemon.
	  It performs as a [captive/open/active] portal. When run on a gateway/router
	  on a network, all web requests are redirected until the client either logs
	  in or clicks "I Accept" to an AUP. The gateway daemon then changes the
	  firewall rules on the gateway to pass traffic for that client (based on IP
	  address and MAC address).
