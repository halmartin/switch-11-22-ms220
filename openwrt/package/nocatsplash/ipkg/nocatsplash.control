Description: NoCatSplash is an Open Public Network Gateway Daemon.
 It performs as a [captive/open/active] portal. When run on a gateway/router
 on a network, all web requests are redirected until the client either logs
 in or clicks "I Accept" to an AUP. The gateway daemon then changes the
 firewall rules on the gateway to pass traffic for that client (based on IP
 address and MAC address).
