	  dnscrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly as your
	  local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and authenticating requests
	  using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server.
	  The DNSCrypt protocol uses high-speed high-security elliptic-curve cryptography
	  and is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on securing communications between
	  a client and its first-level resolver.
