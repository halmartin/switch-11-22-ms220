	  The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications 
	  that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs 
	  and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes 
	  additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command 
	  lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like 
	  history expansion on previous commands.
