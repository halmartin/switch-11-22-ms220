	  Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending 
	  applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone 
	  language. Lua is free software.
	  
	  Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description 
	  constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is 
	  dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has automatic memory 
	  management with garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, 
	  scripting, and rapid prototyping.
	  
	  Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and 
	  compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals are 
	  simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The result is a 
	  fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems 
	  too.

	  This package contains the LUA shared libraries, needed by other programs.
