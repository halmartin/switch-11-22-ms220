	  A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your 
	  mail hub. It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no 
	  mail spool to poke around in, and no daemons running in the background. 
	  Mail is simply forwarded to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy 
	  configuration.
