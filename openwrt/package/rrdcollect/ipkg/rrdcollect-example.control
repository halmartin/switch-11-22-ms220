Description: Example setup for Round-Robin Database (RRD) collecting daemon
 RRDcollect is a daemon which polls certain files in /proc/
 directory, gathering data and storing it inside RRDtool's
 database files.  Being written in C should be both fast
 and resources-friendly.  Supports both scanf(3)-style
 pattern matches and perl compatible regular expressions.
