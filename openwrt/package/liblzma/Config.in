	  liblzma is a general purpose data compression library with
	  an API similar to that of zlib. liblzma supports multiple
	  algorithms, of which LZMA2 is currently the primary algorithm.
	  The native file format is .xz, but also the legacy .lzma
	  format and raw streams (no headers at all) are supported.
