		VGP (Virtual Gateway Protocol)is a very simple protocol able to
		work in a way similar to Cisco(c) HSRP. It implements the idea
		of Virtual Gateway to provide fault tollerance (and load
		balancing) on your net. Each client on your net has as its
		default gateway the virtual gateway and not the real router.
