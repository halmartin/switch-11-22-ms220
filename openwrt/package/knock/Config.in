	  It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface, 
	  looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client 
	  makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a 
	  port on the server. This port need not be open -- since 
	  knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic 
	  even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server 
	  detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command 
	  defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open 
	  up holes in a firewall for quick access.
