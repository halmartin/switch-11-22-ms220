	  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
	  display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
	  server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
	  not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
	  to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
	  scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
	  put friendly user interface on it.
	  
	  http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/
	  
	  This package contains command line tools used to manage RRDs.
	  
	  This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into 
	  librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with 
	  separate dynamic linked libraries.
