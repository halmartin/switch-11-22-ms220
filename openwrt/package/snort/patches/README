Summary of patches for 2.9.11.1:
  01-make-autoreconf-compatible.patch:
    - replaces error functions in configure script with echos for cross compiling
      messages. It's unfortunate that we can't run these tests when cross
      compiling, but it works.
  02-fix-unixsock.patch
    - adds more information to the alert packet. See r88198.
  03-warn-on-gid_sid-suppress.patch
    - If a rule is whitelisted twice, we display a warning instead of creating an
    error. This is nice if we make mistakes on our backend. See r90462.
  04-fix-gzip-zlib-memleak.patch
    - Fixes a memory leak introduced when processing gzipped files with zlib
      1.2.11. See 294c65bf2ac5c0d54ce362f4e152b4cc7ef07a57. This should not be
      needed if it is ever fixed upstream.

Deprecated Patches from 2.9.8.3:
  01-cross-compile.patch:
    - This patch also helped us get around the cross compiling tests. However it
      patched the configure script which is a hacky because configure.in generates
      the configure script via autoconf. For 2.9.11.1 we have put these changes in
      configure.in. In the future, any changes should be made to configure.in
      which is the top most build script.
  04-extra-libs.patch:
    - This patch modifies `configure` rather than `configure.in`, which means
      changes don't persist across builds. It was used to for potentially adding a
      static compilation flag for the snort binary but was not used.
  05-prefer-static-lib-yes.patch:
    - Another attempt at making a static snort binary. It should have patched
      configure.in rather than configure for easy recompilation. This is no longer
      needed.
