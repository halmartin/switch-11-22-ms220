	  parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP bridging.
	  This is useful for creation of transparent firewalls and bridging networks 
	  with different MAC protocols. Also, unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP 
	  bridging allows to bridge Ethernet networks behind wireless nodes without 
	  using WDS or layer 2 bridging.
