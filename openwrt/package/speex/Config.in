	  Speex is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free audio compression 
	  format designed for speech. The Speex Project aims to lower the 
	  barrier of entry for voice applications by providing a free 
	  alternative to expensive proprietary speech codecs. Moreover, Speex 
	  is well-adapted to Internet applications and provides useful features 
	  that are not present in most other codecs.
