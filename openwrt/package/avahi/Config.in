	  Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network -- 
	  this means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and 
	  instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers 
	  to print to or find files being shared. This kind of technology is already 
	  found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf') 
	  and is very convenient.
