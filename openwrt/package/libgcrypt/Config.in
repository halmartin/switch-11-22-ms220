	  This is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from 
	  GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic building blocks: 
	  symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish, Arcfour), hash 
	  algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for all 
	  hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, DSA), large 
	  integer functions, random numbers and a lot of supporting functions.
